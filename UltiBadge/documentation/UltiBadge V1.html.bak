    <p>What you've got to play with: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arduino Nano</li>
      <li>Accelerometer (and possibly Gyro)</li>
      <li>2 LED displays, 8x8 matrix</li>
      <li>5 tactile switches, a d-pad and an action switch</li>
      <li>Infrared transmit and receive</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>This was a quick and dirty badge design that was included in a PCB order
      for another project. It works, we're having fun with it, but be prepared
      for a little hacking if you take this one on. It will be revised in the
      near future and a new PCB will be available. If you want to re-use your
      nano, displays etc. you might consider using sockets on the PCB. </p>

    <h2>Parts List:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Motherboard PCB - see @raycrampton on MatterMost</li>
      <li>$5 - Arduino Nano: Knox Makers Electronics Store or your favorite
        supplier</li>
      <li>$4 - 2x 8x8 LED display modules with MAX7912 driver. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G29DKHB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">This
          one is pretty cost effective</a> but needs to be cut into individual
        8x8 LED modules. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Almencla-MAX7219-Serial-Unsoldered-Display/dp/B07LDCFW26/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=8x+led+max7219&amp;qid=1553182245&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-15">This
          will work</a> if you dont' want to have to cut them up.</li>
      <li>$2.50 - Tactile switches: Knox Makers Electronics Store or your
        favorite supplier of 6x6 momentary contact switches (use normally open
        to avoid having to modify shared software)</li>
      <li>$2-$10 Accelerometer - the board is laid out to match the pinout of
        the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Adafruit-Triple-Axis-Accelerometer-14-bit-MMA8451/dp/B00SK8LS4Q/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=mma8451&amp;qid=1553182405&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1">AdaFruit
          MMA-8451 3-axis accelerometer</a>. I play to revise this to match the
        more widely available, less expensive, and with gyro <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Deegoo-Arduino-MPU-6050-sensors-Accelerometer/dp/B07L5L1HPL/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mpu6050&amp;qid=1553182540&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-13">MPU-6050</a>.</li>
      <li>$0.05 - C1, C2, C3 = 0.1uF 0805 SMT ceramic capacitor, power supply
        bypass</li>
      <li>$0.05 - C4 - 10uF 4.3x4.3 SMT electrolytic capacitor, power supply
        bypass</li>
      <li>$0.50 - D3 - 3A diode, SMB (DO-214AA) case, MBRS360BT3G. This shorts
        out the supply if it's accidentally reverse biased. You can skip this
        part or hack in a leaded 1N400x.</li>
      <li>$0.05 - R1 = 220 Ohms 0805 SMT resistor. This sets Tx Infrared diode
        current</li>
      <li>$0.05 - R2 = 100 Ohms 0805 SMT resistor. This helps filter noise into
        the infrared receiver.</li>
      <li>$0.15 - U4 - SOIC-8 EEPROM, FT24C04A-USG-T or Microchip 24AA04</li>

    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Female header sockets:</h2>
    <p>Solder female header pins onto board, if you want to be able to
      remove/replace/reuse modules. Good candidates are the Arduino, the 8x8 LED
      displays and the accelerometer module. These headers hold OK but don't be
      surprised in the displays or module are easy to accidentally pull out of
      their sockets.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Ray/Dropbox/Projects/kicad/km-ultimate-badge-kit/github-content/ultibadge-female-header.jpg"
        style="width:400px;" alt="Female Header Pins" title="Female Header Pins"></div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Aligning Header Pins When Soldering:</h2>
    <p>When soldering header pin strips onto PCBs, a solderless breadboard can
      be helpful in aligning things properly. Insert the pins into the
      protoboard, then the module over the pins and solder. Be quick, if you
      overheat the pins they might melt the plastic in the proto board.</p>

        style="width:300px;" alt="soldering header pins" title="soldering header pins"></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
    </div>
    <h2>LED Module Prep:</h2>
    <p>Prepare the LED modules by singulating them (a double 8x8 won't fit
      right, it needs to be two singles). Attach header pins as shown, make sure
      they are well aligned (prepindicular to the PCB):</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Ray/Dropbox/Projects/kicad/km-ultimate-badge-kit/github-content/ultibadge-led-module2.jpg"
        style="height:300px;" alt="led module" title="led module">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="file:///C:/Users/Ray/Dropbox/Projects/kicad/km-ultimate-badge-kit/github-content/ultibadge-led-module1.jpg"
        style="height:300px;" alt="led module" title="led module"></div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Arduino Nano Prep:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Prepare the Arduino Nano by soldering on its header pins, if they aren't
      already soldered in.</p>
    <p>Clip the pin labeled 3V3 on the Arduino Nano:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Ray/Dropbox/Projects/kicad/km-ultimate-badge-kit/github-content/ultibadge-removed-pin.jpg"
        style="width:700px;" alt="Remove 3V3 pin from Arduino" title="Remove 3V3 pin from Arduino"></div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Install the Arduino:</h2>
    <p>Now insert the Arduino board into the Motherboard or the sockets on the
      Motherboard. It may take a little massaging to get it to seat in. If you
      didn't use sockets then solder the Arduino pins to the motherboard on the
      bottom.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Add a small jumper between the pins shown (The 5.5V pin and the hole that
      would have had the 3.3V pin in it):</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Ray/Dropbox/Projects/kicad/km-ultimate-badge-kit/github-content/ultibadge-vcc-jumper.jpg"
        style="width:500px;" alt="add vcc jumper" title="add vcc jumper"></div>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Configure External EEPROM:<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The Arduino Nano has 1kB of EEPROM built in. If you think you'll want
      more memory than that (for a lot of graphics for the LED displays for
      example) you can add the SMT EEPROM at this point. At minimum you need the
      IC U4 and its supply bypass capacitor C1. R5 is a 10k Ohm resistor to
      ground if the write-protect pin on the IC you're using doesn't internally
      tie it to ground. A0, A1, A2 are solder bridges and can be used on some
      ICs to set it's address on the I2C bus. You should be able to leave them
      open but consult your data sheet to be sure.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>R100 and R117 are pull-up resistors for the I2C lines. You can almost
      certainly get away without using them but it's good practice to include
      them. 4.7 k Ohms or so should be about right.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Supply Bypassing:</h2>
    <p>C5 isn't needed. C3 is only needed if you're using an infrared
      transmitter. C4 is good practice to include and is polarized so make sure
      it doesn't go in backwareds.</p>
    <p>D3 is for reverse polarity and can be omitted. If you do include it make
      sure to get the orientation correct, it's a polarized devices.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Insert LED Displays</h2>
    <p>Push the LED displays into their sockets or solder them into the
      motherboard.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Infrared Transmit and Receive:</h2>
    <p>If you'd like to include an infrared transmit diode , solder R1 (220 ohms
      is recommended for close to 20mA bias in the LED). Make sure the diode
      goes in with the right polarity. A notes the anode.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to include an infrared receiver then you get to hack the
      board a little since it's laid out only for a regular 3mm photodiode which
      I've learned is a pain to use compared to a regular IR receiver. </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Tactile Switches:</h2>
    <p>The holes on the PCB are a little on the small side so the switches may
      need a lot of rocking and massaging to get them through. Orientation
      doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>If you don't use header pins, Arduino or displays might need some
      delicate massaging to get them through the holes in the board.<br>
